This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of the NREGA (National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) project. The analysis focuses on key metrics like total workers, job cards issued, average wage rates, and approved labor budgets across different Indian states and districts.

## 📖 Overview

The project visualizes data on various metrics like the total number of workers, job cards issued, average daily wages, and distribution of Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) workers.

## 🎯 Project Goals
To analyze NREGA data and highlight key metrics at state and district levels.
To identify patterns in job card issuance, worker participation, and wage distribution.
To present actionable insights using interactive visualizations for better understanding and decision-making.
